The chart is borrowed liberally from http://kenandavis.com/projects/a_season_visualized/ and uses Rickshaw, which uses D3.

The data comes directly from ESPN's json response, sampled every 10 minutes (a unique index on the database prevents
multiple records from being saved).

The scraper and server are in Node.JS and use PostgreSQL to store data (the schema is in schema.sql)

If you don't node, you can deposit a download of series.json in /public and run `python -m SimpleHTTPServer`,
`ruby -run -e httpd . -p 8000`, `php -S localhost:8000`, or webserver of your choice using /public as the document root.
